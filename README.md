# 🔍📄 10-K Risk Factor Summarization with LLMs 🤖

![Problem](https://github.com/WilfredoLandaverde/10-K-Risk-Factor-Summarization-Using-LLMs/blob/bc20194c98e3f2fd67d279c1c06408502feaea7c/Images/Image1.png)

The “Risk Factors” section of a 10-K report often spans over 20 pages, detailing the challenges and uncertainties a company faces. The length and complexity of this section make it time consuming to analyze and difficult to compare across companies.

As part of a competitive intelligence and financial risk analysis initiative, I developed a prototype that leverages Generative AI to identify and extract the "Risk Factors" section, the solution accelerates the review process while maintaining accuracy. Furthermore, it generates a ranked summary of the risk factors based on their potential financial impact, offering decision-makers a clearer view of where a competitor may be struggling and/or preparing to pivot.

This Allows to reverse engineer the competitor's disclosed risk to understand their strategic focus, operational weaknesses or emerging threats, facilitating competitive intelligence.

# 🔥📊 Output Demonstration (Amazon Inc.)
In this example, after downloading the 10-K report from Amazon Inc., the code automatically locates and extracts the "Risk Factors" section. Using LLMs, it then generates a ranked summary of the most financially impactful risks, followed by a detailed breakdown of each risk’s effect on specific areas of the P&L and balance sheet. This includes the underlying assumptions, enabling us to analyze the model’s chain of thought and rationale.
